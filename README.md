#Bitcoin~GPU  The impact of virtual currency mining tide on GPU and social repercussions

###This is the data exploration report of our group, which aims to study the shortage of computing chips caused by mining between 2008 and 2021

##Research steps

- 1.Explore the price of Bitcoin BTC and Ethereum ETH from 2009 to 2021
- 2.Explore the price of GPU in 2014-2021 (take GTX1060, GTX1660Ti, RTX2060, RTX3060 as the main research object)
- 3.Analyze the data of the above two and make corresponding charts (In this part, I will think more dimensions and consider how to get more necessary content)
- 4.At the same time, the hot words related to mining in each year from 2014 to 2021 were searched (the evaluation of gamers, miners, melon-eating people, etc.), and the hot word cloud would be made. 
- 5.In addition, if we have enough time or lack of content, we will add the discussion on BTH, and analyze its differences with Bitcoin and social evaluation
- 6.In the end, we will make a graph like the following memorabilia (with the price curve of Bitcoin in the background and the price curve of graphics card in the front with our analysis results/social evaluation).
